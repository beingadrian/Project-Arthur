    * In the future, use RealmCards (or something similar) instead of [String:AnyObject]s. The app runs entirely on the internal database, and as such, passing the "queue" of cards is only reasonably done from internally. This way, there will be a more solid system of parsing. Inside this function, create an "AVSpeechUtterance" class, and use that to approach the vocalization of your cards.
